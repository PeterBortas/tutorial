<h2>What is a data type?</h2>
<p>Pike works with <strong>string</strong>ms<strong> in a Pike program, we write <code>int</code>. For the type </strong><strong> in a Pike program, we write <code>int</code>. For the type </strong> world!&quot;<code>. Each data item has, or "is", a certain type: **17** and **-4717** both have the type **integer**, and</code>&quot;Hello world!&quot;<code>has the type **string**. If we want to refer to the data type **integer** in a Pike program, we write</code>int<code>. For the type **string**, we write</code>string`.</p>
<p>Each variable, method, and method parameter also has a type. The types of these determines which data items you can put in the variable, return from the method, or use as arguments to the method. An integer variable, created with</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">int i;</code></pre>
<p>can only contain integer values. If we try to put something else, such as a string, in this variable, Pike will try to discover the discrepancy and complain about it. This is called <strong>type checking</strong>.</p>
<p><code>string</code> and <code>int</code> are <strong>classes</strong>types<strong> in Pike. You can also create your own data types, or </strong>classes**. We have already seen some examples of this, for example the class <code>Query</code>, which is part of the module <code>Protocols.HTTP</code>, and which is used to contain the data we get when we retrieve a page from the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>We will examine each individual data type in some detail in a later chapter, but this chapter will give an introduction to data types in general.</p>
<h2>Different Kinds of Types</h2>
<p>The data types in Pike can be divided into three categories: the <strong>container types</strong>nt<code>,</code>float<code>, and</code>string<code>), the **container types** (</code>array<code>,</code>mapping<code>,</code>multiset<code>), and then the three types</code>program<code>,</code>object<code>and</code>function`. We will start by looking at the basic types.</p></div>
