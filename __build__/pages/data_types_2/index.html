<h1>The Basic Types</h1>
<p>These are the <strong>basic types</strong> in Pike:</p>
<ul>
<li>integer (written <code>int</code> in Pike)</li>
<li>floating-point number (written <code>float</code>)</li>
<li>string (written <code>string</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>They are basic in the sense that data items of these data types can't contain other data items. When a data item of a basic type is stored in a variable, it is the data item itself that is stored, and not just a reference to it, as explained earlier.</p>
<h2>The Data Type <code>int</code></h2>
<p>Integer values can be written in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>In decimal (that is, base 10) format, i e the normal way to write numbers, such as <code>78</code>.</li>
<li>In octal (that is, base 8) format, with a leading <code>0</code>, such as <code>0116</code> (which is equal to <code>78</code> in decimal notation).</li>
<li>In hexadecimal (that is, base 16) format, with a leading <code>0x</code>, such as <code>0x4e</code> (which is also equal to <code>78</code> in decimal notation).</li>
<li>In binary (ones and zeroes) format, with aleading <code>0b</code>, such as <code>0b1001110</code> (which again is equal to <code>78</code> in decimal notation).</li>
<li>As a character literal within single quotes, which will give the Unicode code point for that character. For example, <code>'N'</code> will give the code point for the character <strong>N</strong> (which is equal to <code>78</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use normal arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, with integers, but you can also consider integers as sequences of bits and, apply bitwise operations on them.</p>
<p>For example, the integer value <strong>1976</strong>is stored internally as the sequence of bits <strong>1976</strong>11<strong>, which is equal to </strong>hift it three positions with the expression <code>247 &lt;&lt; 3</code>, giving the bit pattern <strong>1976</strong>11000<strong>, which is equal to </strong>1976**.</p>
<p>Integers in Pike can be very large. For small integers (usually less than 2 billion or so), Pike will use the computer's own, hardware-supported way of representing integers. For larger integers, Pike will use &quot;bignums&quot;. These are slower, but can be arbitrarily large. Just like the smaller integers, bignums are represented exactly, without any rounding errors.</p>
<p>As a programmer, you will usually not need to worry about the difference between bignums and smaller integers. There may however be some operations, for example certain methods in certain C modules, that cannot handle bignums but work with smaller integers.</p>
<p>Some operations that you can apply to integers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check if it is an integer</strong>
<p><code>intp(*something*)</code> returns <strong>0</strong> if the value <em>something</em> is an integer, otherwise <strong>0</strong>. Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">if (intp(u))
write("The integer is " + u + ".\n");
else
write("It is not an integer.\n");</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>Get a random number</strong>
<p><code>random(*limit*)</code> returns a random value which is greater or equal to <strong>0</strong> and less than the integer <em>limit</em>.</p></li>
<li><strong>Reverse the bits</strong>
<p><code>reverse(*integer-value*)</code> returns an integer with the bits in the <em>integer-value</em> in reverse order.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Data Type <code>float</code></h2>
<p>Real numbers, which are numbers that can have a fractional part, such as <strong>floating-point numbers</strong>, are represented in the computer as <strong>floating-point numbers</strong>. Floating-point numbers can be used to represent very large numbers, but with limited precision. The number of significant digits is the same, no matter the magnitude of the value.</p>
<p>You can write floating-point values in two ways, as usual with decimals, or in exponential form with an <code>e</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">3.1415926535
-123.0001
12.0
1e6 // 1 times 10 to the power of 6, i e one million
2.0e-6 // 2.0 times 10 to the power of -6, i e two one-millionths
-1.0e-2 // Minus one hundredth</code></pre>
<p>Some operations that you can apply to floating-point numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check if it is a floating-point number</strong>
<p><code>floatp(*something*)</code> returns <strong>0</strong> if the value <em>something</em> is a floating-point number, otherwise <strong>0</strong>.</p></li>
<li><strong>Round downwards</strong>
<p><code>floor(*float-value*)</code> returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to <em>float-value</em>, but as a floating-point number. For example, <code>floor(7.3)</code> gives <strong>7</strong><strong>). If you do want the integer value, you can use an explicit type conversion: <code>(int)7.3</code> gives you the integer </strong>3` gives you the integer <strong>7</strong>.</p></li>
<li><strong>Round upwards</strong>
<p><code>ceil(*float-value*)</code> returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to <em>float-value</em>, as a floating-point number. For example, <code>ceil(7.3)</code> gives <strong>8</strong><strong> (and not the integer </strong>8**).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Data Type <code>string</code></h2>
<p>Strings are sequences of characters, and are written within double quotes (<code>"</code>) in Pike:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">"scorch"
"Hello world!"
"Woe to you, oh Earth and Sea"
""</code></pre>
<p>The last one is the empty string. Special characters, such as the double quote character, need to be preceded by a backslash character (<code>\</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\"</code> to get a double quote (<code>"</code>) in the string</li>
<li><code>\\</code> to get a backslash character (<code>\</code>)</li>
<li><code>\n</code> to get a newline character</li>
<li><code>\t</code> to get a tab character</li>
<li><code>\r</code> to get a carriage return</li>
<li><code>\0</code> to get a NUL character, i e the character with character code <strong>0</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of strings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">"One line\nAnother line\nA third line"
"Strings are written within \" characters."</code></pre>
<p>You can use Unicode code points instead of the characters themselves. If you write <code>\d</code> followed by a decimal (that is, normal base 10) number, it will be replaced by the character with that Unicode code point. The same goes for <code>\x</code> followed by a hexadecimal (base 16) number, and a single <code>\</code> followed by an octal (that is, base 8) number. The <code>\0</code> is actually an example of this. These four strings are identical:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">"Hello world"
"Hello \d119orld"
"Hello \x77orld"
"Hello \167orld"
"\d78""2OH" // "N2OH"</code></pre>
<p>If the character following your code point number is also a number, follow your code point with <code>""</code>, to tell Pike that this was the end of your code point, and the following &quot;2&quot; is its own character, not another digit of the code point.</p>
<p>Strings in Pike are what we call &quot;shared&quot;, which means that if two or more strings contain exactly the same characters, there will still be only one copy of it in memory.</p>
<p>Some operations that you can apply to strings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check if it is a string</strong>
<p><code>stringp(*something*)</code> returns <strong>0</strong> if the value <em>something</em> is a string, otherwise <strong>0</strong>.</p></li>
<li><strong>Concatenation</strong>
<p>Strings can be concatenated with the <code>+</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">string s1 = "Hello";
string s2 = " ";
string s3 = "world!";
write(s1 + s2 + s3 + "\n");</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>Concatenation of string literals</strong>
<p><strong>String literals</strong>, who are strings within double quotes that are written in a program, can be concatenated by just putting them after each other:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">write("Hello"  " "  "world!" + "\n");</code></pre>
<p>(This is, incidentally, how the terminated numeric escapes above work under the hood.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Pike has many powerful built-in operations for working with strings. Read more about those in the chapter about string handling.</p></div>
