<p>Here are two more examples of method definitions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">int getDex()
{
  int oldDex = Dex;
  Dex = 0;
  return oldDex;
}

private void
show_user(int|string id, void|string full_name)
{
  write("Id: " + id + "\n");
  if (full_name)
    write("Full name: " + full_name + "\n");
}</code></pre>
<p>The method <code>getDex</code> returns the value of a non-local variable called <code>Dex</code>, but also changes the value of that variable to zero (<strong>0</strong>).</p>
<p>The method <code>show_user</code> expects to receive either one or two arguments. The first argument can be either an integer or a string. The second argument is optional, but if it is present it must be a string.</p>
<p>Here are some valid statements that contain calls to the two methods above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">getDex();
show_user(19);
show_user("john");
show_user(19, "John Doe");
show_user("john", "John Doe");</code></pre>
<h2>Side-effects in Methods</h2>
<p>When working with methods, you may want to be careful with <strong>side-effects</strong>. A side-effect is anything that the method causes to change or happen, except for the returned value. Sometimes the side-effects are the reason for the method, and sometimes they are a dangerous misfeature. In the three examples above, <code>getDex</code> has the side-effect of setting the value of the non-local variable <code>Dex</code> to 0, and <code>show_user</code> has the side-effect that it writes some text to the standard output. We can guess that <code>show_user</code> has been created just to write that text, so this side-effect of <code>show_user</code> is probably not a problem. On the other hand, if a programmer uses <code>getDex</code> to get the value of the variable <code>Dex</code>, it could come as a surprise that this method also changes the value.</p></div>
