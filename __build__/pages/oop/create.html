      <div class="container"><h1>How to Create a Class</h1>
<p>To create a class, you write a <strong>class definition</strong>, with all the member variables and methods. For the class <code>animal</code>, which we have used above, the class definition may look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">class animal
{
  string name;
  float weight;

  void create(string n, float w)
  {
    name = n;
    weight = w;
  }

  void eat(string food)
  {
    write(name + " eats some " + food + ".\n");
    weight += 0.5;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Some explanations about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A member variable, such as <code>name</code>, exists once in each cloned object, not in the class itself.</li>
<li>When a method, such as <code>eat</code>, refers to a member variable, such as <code>weight</code>, it will use that variable in the same object that it was called for. For example, when we call <code>my_dog-&gt;eat("quiche")</code>, it is the <code>weight</code> in the object <code>my_dog</code> that is increased.</li>
<li>The method <code>create</code> is special. This method that handles the arguments that you give when you clone an object. (C++ programmers would call this a &quot;constructor&quot;.)</li>
<li>You can also have a method called <code>destroy</code>. This method is what C++ programmers would call the &quot;destructor&quot;, i e a method that is run just before the object disappears. A destructor is sometimes needed for cleanup, but much more seldom in Pike than in C++, since Pike has automatic garbage collection.</li>
