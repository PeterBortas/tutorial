<p>Assuming that we have the class <code>animal</code>, we can define some variables that can be used to store animals. Remember that the class is also a <strong>data type</strong>. We can also create some animals to put in those variables. To create an animal, we use the syntax <code>*classname*()</code>, i e the name of the class followed by a pair of parentheses.</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">animal some_animal;
some_animal = animal();
animal my_dog = animal();</code></pre>
<p>To access a member variable in an object, we use the syntax <code>*object-expression*-&gt;*variable-name*</code>, i e the object followed by the operator <code>-&gt;</code> followed by the name of the variable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">my_dog-&gt;name = "Fido";
my_dog-&gt;weight = 10.0;
some_animal-&gt;name = "Glorbie";
write("My dog is called " + my_dog-&gt;name + ".\n");
write("Its weight is " + my_dog-&gt;weight + ".\n");
write("That animal is called " + some_animal-&gt;name + ".\n");</code></pre>
<p>Most objects need some initial values for its member variables. For example, every animal needs a name and a weight. One way to handle this is to set those variables separately, as we have done above. A better way is to design the class in a way that lets it set the variables immediately when an object is cloned from the class. You can then give the values when cloning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">animal piglet = animal("Piglet", 6.3);</code></pre>
<p>We can call a method in an object, with a similar &quot;<code>-&gt;</code>&quot; syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pike">my_dog-&gt;eat("quiche"); // Real dogs eat quiche.
write("Its weight is now " + my_dog-&gt;weight + ".\n");</code></pre></div>
