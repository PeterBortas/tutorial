<h2>Programs Within Programs: Object-Oriented Pike</h2>
<p>As we have said before, a <strong>instance</strong> a description of a type of thing. You can <strong>instance</strong>e class to create <strong>instance</strong> Each object is a <strong>instance</strong>ometimes called <strong>instance</strong>) of the class.</p>
<p>A class contains some variables, which are sometimes called <strong>member variables</strong>. The variables are attributes or characteristics of the objects, and each object will have its own set of the member variables. For example, if the class <code>animal</code> has the member variables <code>name</code> and <code>weight</code>, then each animal will have those two variables, so each animal can have a name and a weight.</p>
<p>A class also contains some methods. (C++ programmers would call them &quot;member functions&quot;.) The methods describe things that the objects can do.</p>
<p>For example, if the class &quot;animal&quot; has the method <code>eat</code>, then you can call that method in any animal, to make it eat. Well, of course it won't really eat, since it's just some data in the computer and not a real animal. But the method can change the member variables, for example by increasing the value of <code>weight</code> for that animal.</p></div>
