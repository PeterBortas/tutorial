# Some Terminology

First of all, some useful terms:

<list type="ul">
<item>

"addition".
</item>

<item>
An **operator** is the symbol we use in a program to write the
operation, such as the operator `+`.
</item>

<item>
An **operand** is a thing that an operation is applied to. For
example, in the expression `7 + a` there are two operands:
`7` and `a`.
</item>

<item>
An **expression** is what you get when you combine operators and
operands according to the grammar rules of the language.

In this chapter we will examine how we write expressions in Pike.
We will look at all the operations that have their own operators.
