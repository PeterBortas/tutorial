# How to Create a Class

To create a class, you write a **class definition**, with all
the member variables and methods. For the class `animal`, which
we have used above, the class definition may look like this:

```pike
class animal
{
  string name;
  float weight;

  void create(string n, float w)
  {
    name = n;
    weight = w;
  }

  void eat(string food)
  {
    write(name + " eats some " + food + ".\n");
    weight += 0.5;
  }
}
```

Some explanations about this:

<list type="ul">
<item>
A member variable, such as `name`, exists once in each
cloned object, not in the class itself.
</item>

<item>
When a method, such as `eat`, refers to a member variable,
such as `weight`, it will use that variable in the same object
that it was called for. For example, when we call
`my_dog->eat("quiche")`, it is the `weight` in the
object `my_dog` that is increased.
</item>

<item>
The method `create` is special. This method that handles the
arguments that you give when you clone an object. (C++ programmers
would call this a "constructor".)
</item>

<item>
You can also have a method called `destroy`. This method is
what C++ programmers would call the "destructor", i e a method that
is run just before the object disappears. A destructor is sometimes
needed for cleanup, but much more seldom in Pike than in C++, since
Pike has automatic garbage collection.
